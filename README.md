# Classic Clawpack

This package hosts the single-grid version of the Clawpack code.  

See the main [clawpack/clawpack repository](https://github.com/clawpack/clawpack)
 README for more links.  

See the [Documentation](https://www.clawpack.org/)
for more details and installation instructions.

All of the Clawpack solvers include the *classic* algorithms described in
LeVeque's book [Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic
Problems](https://www.clawpack.org/fvmhp_materials/).
Many of the examples from that book can be run using code in the
[Clawpack apps](https://www.clawpack.org/apps.html) repository, see
[Examples from the book FVMHP](https://www.clawpack.org/fvmbook.html).
